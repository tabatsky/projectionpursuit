# projectionpursuit
Automated projection pursuit (APP) clustering is an alternative clustering approach that alleviates the curse of dimensionality by sequentially projecting high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional representation as described in [Lifting the curse from high dimensional data: Automated projection pursuit clustering for the variety of biological data modalities
](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.18.589981v1). Here we present an implementation of APP clustering and a scRNAseq dataset upon which APP was validated. 

### Installation

Scripts to run APP are found in the APP and Label Transfer folder and the DockerAPP folder (to run within a Docker container) and more information is found in the readme files in those folders. Please refer to the **RUN_ME_APP_and_QFMatch.py** Python script or **RUN_ME_APP_and_QFMatch.sh** shell script in the APP and Label Transfer folder to run the scripts.

Before running scripts please make sure to install Python dependencies using the **deps_python.sh** shell script for macOS or the **deps_python.cmd** script for Windows. You also may need to install the Visual Studio Command Line Tools and the Windows SDK before installing dependencies for Windows.

If running APP, dml_for_app, and QFMatch in sequence, note that QFMatch requires the some of intermediate files generated by APP, so they shouldn't be removed or renamed prior to QFMatch.

#### The scripts were tested with the following Python versions:

Windows - Python 3.11.9
* As of July 2024, Windows can run with the latest version of all packages, with two exceptions:
  * ````phenograph```` must be set to version 1.5.3 due to an error caused by ````multiprocessing.pool````
  * ````numpy```` must be set to version 1.23.5 due to ````phenograph```` referencing a removed data type

macOS - Python 3.8 via homebrew:

````brew install python@3.8````

### project folders
* pbmc_data - scRNA-seq data linked [here](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html), principal component values for each cell from the dataset, and a script to process the data and generate UMAPs
* APP and Label Transfer - scripts to run the automated projection pursuit clustering along with the scripts and files to run the label transfer pipeline after APP clustering
* DockerAPP - a script to run projection pursuit within the Docker container
